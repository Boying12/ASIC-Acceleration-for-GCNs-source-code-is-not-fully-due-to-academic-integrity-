The design includes feature aggregation and transformation using a sparse COO adjacency format to reduce computation cost. The GCN module is implemented in Verilog, synthesized with Design Compiler, and placed and routed using Innovus. Post-APR simulation and power analysis are performed while meeting a latency constraint under 100 ns.
